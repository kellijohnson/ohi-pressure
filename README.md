# ohi-pressure

## Purpose

A repository for the analysis of variability in pressure data related to
climate change for the purpose of calculating the ocean health index (OHI).

A manuscript will be submitted to x
by Alma, L., Johnson, K.F., and Koontz, E.
in 2018.

## To do list

  -[ ] Decide if the analysis will include all four related pressures
  (sea-level rise, SLR; sea-surface temperature; SST,
  ultraviolet radiation, UV; and ocean acidification, OA) or just one.
  -[ ] How to add variability to the chosen pressures.
  -[ ] Author order.
  -[ ] Time line.
  -[ ] Add latex variability document to github (EK).
  -[ ] Need to find a reference for the range of variability to look at (EK).
  -[ ] Optimize the loops for the SST calculation, maybe not read and write so many rasters, but may run into memory errors.
  -[ ] Add location of sea surface temperature data to the master file.
